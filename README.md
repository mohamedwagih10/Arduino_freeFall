# Arduino_freeFall
 Free Fall Experiment Arduino Code

This Arduino code is designed for conducting a free fall experiment using an Arduino board, a distance sensor, and Bluetooth communication.

## Components Required:
- Arduino board
- Distance sensor
- Bluetooth module
- LiquidCrystal I2C display
- LEDs

## Installation:
1. Connect the required components to the Arduino board according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload this code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage:
1. Power on the Arduino board.
2. Open a serial terminal or Bluetooth terminal to communicate with the Arduino.
3. Send commands to start the experiment and receive data.
4. The Arduino will measure the distance, time, and acceleration during free fall and display the results on the LCD screen.
